# Book-Stats
## What is This
The intention of this project is to have a final product which can be used to use a large amount of book data 
both by creating infographics, drawing conclusions from data and allowing use of data from sites such as StoryGraph and
GoodReads, to recommend new books and also provide insights into their data.
## Data Sources
The base data used in this project is sourced from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset
This dataset contains three subsets (Books, Ratings, Users), making up ISBNS, Titles, Authors, Ratings, and User 
Details. In this project this data is processed/augmented/expanded to suit the outlined goals. 

For data expansion, such as genres Google's Books API was used.
