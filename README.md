# Book-Stats
## What is This
The intention of this project is to have a final product which can be used to use a large amount of book data 
both by creating infographics, drawing conclusions from data and allowing use of data from sites such as StoryGraph and
GoodReads, to recommend new books and also provide insights into their data.

## Data Sources
The base data used in this project is sourced from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset
This dataset contains three subsets (Books, Ratings, Users), making up ISBNS, Titles, Authors, Ratings, and User 
Details. 

In this project this data is processed/augmented/expanded to suit the outlined goals. 

Details of the final datasets used are available within the project under the CONTENTS.md file within the Data Folder. 
For data expansion, such as categories Google's Books API was used to retrieve the relevant information. 

## Visualisation of Data
Some basic data analysis has been performed and visualised, within Data/Visualisations, these visuals are currently a 
work in progress with some using limited sample sizes and others just not polished. Nonetheless, they provide an insight 
into the data used for this project and in turn its usability/reliability.
